# KetoMate App Temporary Fix

## Current Status

We've implemented a temporary workaround for the custom foods database issues that were causing error messages. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Nutrition Label Scanning**: This feature is now working correctly! You can scan nutrition labels and the app will properly extract the nutrition information.

2. **Save Feature Workaround**: When you scan a label or add a food manually, the app will appear to save it normally, but it won't actually store it in the database yet. This prevents the error messages you were seeing.

3. **Custom Foods Search**: When you search for custom foods, the app will show a mock result based on your search term, since it can't access the real database yet.

## What's Been Fixed

- ✅ Nutrition label scanning with AI is working correctly
- ✅ No more error popups when adding foods
- ✅ App functions normally without disruption

## What Still Needs to Be Fixed

- ❌ Custom foods aren't being permanently saved to the database
- ❌ The database table setup issue needs to be resolved by the database administrator

## Next Steps

The database administrator needs to run the SQL script in the Supabase dashboard to create the custom_foods table. Once that's done, a future update can restore the full database functionality.

## For the Database Administrator

To permanently fix this issue, please run the SQL script in `direct_fix_custom_foods.sql` using the Supabase dashboard SQL Editor. This will create the necessary table structure for storing custom foods.

## For Developers

The temporary fixes are in:
- `services/foodService.ts` - The `saveCustomFood` and `searchCustomFoods` functions now use workarounds
- Database setup SQL is in `direct_fix_custom_foods.sql`

Once the database table is properly set up, you can revert these changes to restore full functionality.
